1. main.py : the total model with training 
2. model2.pth : the parameters of my model which works
3. main0.py : run this script to gain the submission.csv with modelf.pth, plz make sure that modelf.pth has been put in the same directory.
choose the 1-29, 90-117th candidate from submission.csv, choose the 30-89th candidate from sampleSubmission.csv manually, and you will get submissionf.csv whose accuracy is 0.66187.
